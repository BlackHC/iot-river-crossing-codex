# Project Goals and TODOs

- Implement the river crossing game environment to validate sequences of moves.
- Write solvers for the river crossing game.
- Determine optimal strategies for different `n` and `k` values.
- Investigate and verify for which `n` and `k` there are no solutions.
- Add unit tests for all functionality.
- Explore possible visualizations of solutions.
